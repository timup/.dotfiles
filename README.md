# dotfiles
Files that begin with a dot (.)

### Installation

.dotfiles can be installed like so:

1. Clone the repository into your $HOME.

    ```bash
        $ git clone https://github.com/timup/.dotfiles.git
    ```

2. cd into the .dotfiles directory and run:

    ```bash
        $ ./install
    ```

And, voila! Config.  The install script is a component of the [DotBot][dotbot] submodule.

#### Disclaimer

Install instructions were written for my own reference. These are my personal settings, and they may not be right for you.  Fork away, but ensure that you know what's about to go down before running the install script. 

.dotfiles are installed after running the Thoughtbot [Laptop][laptop] script.
